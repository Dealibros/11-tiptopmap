## Tiptop Map Project

## Description
Tiptop Map Project is a web application that allows you and your family and friends to collect and save your favourite spots and places of Vienna on a map (in the future the idea is to expand to any wished city). 
In this project you will be able to rate selected places and to leave a review.

## Features

- Users can see all spots added and opinions about the place.
- Users can edit and comment on each spot selected. 
- Only the author will be able to edit and delete his review.
- A rating system that allows you to rate the selected spot. An average of all ratings given by you and your friends will be shown.

## Technologies
The application will be built using the following technologies:

- Next.js
- React.js
- PostgreSQL
- Google maps
- API places
- Typescript
- Three.js
- Emotion
- Figma

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
